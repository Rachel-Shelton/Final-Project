# Final Project: Plant Care App

Welcome to Plant Parenthood (hehe)

# How to Use

This app has a plant recommendation component (based on a set of characteristics), user profiles that allow the currently logged in user to make posts and see other peopel's posts, and will eventually include a selling and trading capacity which will allow users to comminucate and share plants with eachother and a community forum for discussing various plant issues and finds.

# Development

I created the plant database used in the project becuase I was unable to find an API with the plant information that was relevant to my app. To compensate, I used the Google Maps Javascript API and programmed it with static markers for some plant nurseries in the Montreal area, including the information about the shop when the marker is clicked.

# Plans for the future

Pagination, working filter, users add their bios and birthday("edit profile connected to separate page with updateUser"), working footer links

# Find Active Site

I was adamant abotu doing this project becuase I really like it, to the point that I bought a domain name for it and run the site, check it out here:
